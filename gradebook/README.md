# Overview

The GradeBook program is a simple program designed to store students and assignments and do calculations to find Grade Percentages and Letter Grades and display these 
calculations for the user. Logically, this program was written to display comprehension of and further understand the Java language.

# Development Environment

This program was written using the VS Code editor with JDK downloaded. In addition, I used The Java Extension Pack through VS Code. The libraries imported into my code include scanner, list and arrayList utilities.

# Future Work

- I look forward to being able add the function to save to a JSON file OR connect to a database. 
- I would also like to add the ability to open this in a frame on the console rather than being tied to the terminal. 
- I would like to add the ability to view assignments and scores for each students.
